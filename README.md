To ensure that the tool works correctly, you must store TechniciansToolbox.psm1 (PowerShell module source file) and TechniciansToolbox.exe in the same directory. If you do not, TechniciansToolbox will not know where to get the PowerShell module and the it won't work.
Please only use this tool if your organization allows it
